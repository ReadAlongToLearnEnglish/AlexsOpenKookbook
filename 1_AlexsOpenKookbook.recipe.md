# 1. Alex's Open Kookbook

I wanted to make a cookbook so i could eat healthier and cheaper and track the calories i eat and hopefully make more recipes which are tasty, filling, cheap, nutritious and easy to prepare. 

It is Kookbook instead of cookbook because of the name of the open source program that reads and displays the files.

I am going to try and maintain two separate repositories of cookbook. AlexsOpenKookbook which i am the sole contributor of and OpenKookbook which can include recipes from others. All recipes will be published and distributed with the MIT license (see below)
