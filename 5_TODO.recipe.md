# 4. Todos 

Recipies i know i want to add to this collection. Todos are recipes ive cooked several times before, but havent written down / calculated calories etc, and Wishlist are dishes i want to be able to cook but im not quite good enough yet e.g. five spice chicken, hand made pasta. chocolate cake from scratch. 

Note: its usually two words 'to do' but coders usually concatenate to 'TODO:'
for an easily searchable to find in their code.
