# 0. Foreword

This is an open cookbook for recipes i have personally made or plan to make. Its called kookbook instead of cookbook as these .recipe.md files are intended to be viewed using kookbook, a free, open source cookbook program however they are also viewable in a text editor. 


### Goals

To be a generic cookbook with simple recipes and help me plan and keep track of calories eaten. The aim is to have calorie counted, simple, easy to prepare, tasty, cheap meals. I hope it can be used as a template cookbook for others and help you make a customised cookbook tuned for your kitchen.

I have spent a lot of time sitting at a computer and eaten more than i should and while I have plans to exercise more and go on a diet, i know that unless i make a significant change in my eating patterns, I cant see anything else happening but me putting weight on again.

Recipes here are based on meals I would typically eat in quantities I currently eat, so i plan to make adjustments like going from 4 to 3 slices of bread for the Baked Beans / Spaghetti on toast recipes.

I want to make a 'Pareto Principle' and generic cookbook with approximate calories for meals as there are different brands with similar products and i did not want to be prescriptive with ingredients.

### Licensing 
This repository is released under the MIT license, which means it is free to download and share with your friends (but i make no warranty about its usefulness)

Each .recipe.md file has its own license as i am likely to make an OpenKookbook project immediately after this is published and putting a MIT license at the bottom of each recipe is the best way to ensure recipes maintain the correct attribution. Recipes should be written using general descriptions of ingredients rather than brand names or trademarks ingredients or equipment. 

While it might be more correct to distribute this under an Open Document licence, i have decided to distribute this under the same license as the kookbook program for compatibility. 

I believe that the recipes themselves are a program in the same vein as code is, just in a different language.

But if anyone is upset there isnt 'software' included in the project, here is a little C++ code 


 #include <cstdio>

int cookHealthyTastyAndCheapFood(){
  printf("Cook Healthy, Tasty and Cheap Food\n");
  return 1;
}

int main (){
  while (1){ 
    cookHealthyTastyAndCheapFood();
  }; 
}
