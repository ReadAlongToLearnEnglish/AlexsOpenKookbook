# 1. Equipment

When cooking you use equipment, some of it is general like pots and pans, and some can be specific like a meat patty press or icecream maker.

The recipes in this cookbook aim to use general equipment, and some cases you might be cooking with only limited equipment available like if
 you are camping or staying in a hotel. 




### Standard Kitchen

Its assumed that most of the cooking you will be doing from this cookbook is done in a standard kitchen and you will have access to :-

A Fridge with freezer

A Microwave

A Kettle

A Toaster

An Oven/ Stovetop with multiple plates, with a grill compartment

Pans and Pots

Baking trays

Cooking utensils such as Wooden spoon, egg flip, tongs and ladle

Plates, Bowls & Cutlery

Containers to store excess food in

Sharp knives for chopping and slicing (i have found a Santoku knife to be very useful)

A Grater

Steamer pot / basket is a standard pot on the bottom and a second tier above has lots of holes in it like a colander to let steam through. This can be useful to cook multiple items like rice and dumplings on the same burner on the stovetop. 

### Kitchenette

In an office, you may not have a full sized kitchen, but have a few items, typically a fridge and power outlets for a kettle, microwave, toaster and sandwich press and you may not be able to make everything in the standard kitchen. 


### Skillet
A skillet is a frypan with an electric element in the bottom of it and it can be a very versatile piece of cooking equipment. 
It can act as a frypan, pot and also be setup to bake roasts. If i was moving into a new place, the box with the skillet would be one of the first to be unpacked. 


### Specialised equipment - Soup Maker

A soup maker is a combination of a blender and a kettle. It can take ingredients and water and complete a cycle based on settings for chunky soup where the blender part is not used or smooth soup where the blender part automatically engages at various points of the cooking cycle.  I have one and found it useful when buying vegetables in 1kg bulk packs (Capsicum, Onions and carrots) and adding a condensed tomato soup can. After purchasing the items, wash and chop the vegetables and they can be frozen in containers premixed to be taken out, added to the soup maker for a relatively hassle free low calorie, filling & tasty meal. 

### Specialised equipment - Bread Maker

A bread maker is a mixing bowl with a paddle and a heating element so that someone can add ingredients like yeast, flour, sugar and water for the machine to mix, prove and bake automatically. I was keen to make bread at home and was unsure about keeping it at the right temperature while it was proving (or raising). I have typically used it to make loaves and its ok but the loaves still have a paddle shaped hole in the bottom. It is able to be used to make dough that can be baked in the oven for loaves or bread rolls. There are also other preprogrammed cycles so that it can operate as a mixer and make pasta from flour and eggs, bake cakes and also make damper where the proving cycle is omitted and it goes straight from mixing to baking. 

### Specialised equipment - Sandwich press (multiple plates)

A typical sandwich press has a flat hotplate on the top and bottom. I've picked up on which has interchangeable plates so you can have plates for making round pancakes, sandwich shaped plates for toasted sandwiches, waffle shaped plates , a grill shaped plate with channels so fat can drain away and a flat plate so the sandwich press can be used to cook eggs or a schnitzel if desired. 

Plates are meant to be changed while cool, and they are taken out for cleaning. 


### Specialised equipment - Pie Maker

A pie maker is similar to a sandwich press but its shaped for pies. The one i have makes smaller pies (but not party sized) and can do 4 at a time. 
It is meant to be used with puff pastry and it has a cutter so that 2 perfectly cut tops and bottoms can be cut from a sheet. When i used it, i typically cooked mince and added in different sauces for flavours like pepper steak, spicy or satay. It could also be used to make quiche with an egg filling and the puff pastry would go further as the tops were not needed. Instead of puff pastry, bread could be buttered on the outside and be used to make jaffles with fillings like tinned spaghetti or baked beans. 

### Specialised equipment - Slow Cooker

A slow cooker has a large bowl which is used to cook large amounts of foods (about 4 litres) for long periods of time (about 6 hours). It can be useful for stews, soups and chillis. I would typically use it for a cook up on a saturday or sunday where i could keep an eye on things and enjoy the smell as it cooked. I had one a fairly long time ago it got retired after a downsizing and move.
